Q1
 The parallel() function takes a list of resistor values and calculates the resistance of the circuit in parallel by the summation of the reciprocals of the resistances and is stored in total_resistance, the finall resistance however is obtained by the reciprocal of the total_resistance.
The potential_divider() functions takes an input Voltage(Input_Voltage) and two resistor values (R1 & R2) stored in Resistors. The voltage drop across each resistor is calculated using the potential divider formula. The voltage across R1 is stored in Output_Volatge1 and the Voltage across R2 is stored in Output_Voltage2.
The temperature check() function determines whether a patient is hypothermic, hyperthermic or has normal body temperature based on the temperatures and units provided(C, F). The temperature threshold for hypothermia is 36.1 degrees C and below and for hyperthermia 37.5 and above and normal body temperature lies between. When the unit Celsius is given the temperature condition is checled against the thresholds, however if the unit is F it first converts to Celsius and then check the thresholds. The function then prints wheteher the patient is, hypothermic, hyperthermic or has normal body temperature

How did I know my girlfriend was telling her friends I was invading her privacy :) 
I read it in her diary :|
